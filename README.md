# Voice Activated Point of Sale

Written by Holly Metzger for Orion Robotics

This is a voice driven POS software intended to be placed on a MARS robotic waiter, which allows end users to place orders, ask questions, and converse with the robot in a natural manner. It uses Pocket Sphinx from CMU for voice to text, then sends the text to a gpt4 chatbot, which responds in a human-like way.
